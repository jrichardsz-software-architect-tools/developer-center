# Devops

DevOps is described in Wikipedia as “a software development methodology that combines software development (Dev) with information technology operations (Ops). The goal of DevOps is to shorten the development life cycle while also delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently in close alignment with business objectives. The DevOps approach is to include automation and event monitoring at all steps of the software build.” …Development + Operations = DevOps. Typical DevOps methodology can overlap with Agile, but it typically picks up once the code is checked in and then addresses the rest of the stages in the value stream (2022, Dan Packer, [Continuous Integration vs. Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment](https://www.plutora.com/blog/continuous-integration-continuous-delivery-continuous-deployment))
